# Next.js 15 Runtime Error

This repository demonstrates a runtime error encountered in a Next.js 15 application when using a specific library or feature.  The error is unexpected and the error message lacks sufficient detail for easy debugging.

## Problem

The `pages/index.js` file in the `bug` folder produces an error during the runtime phase of the app. The root cause is not obvious from the error message, hindering debugging efforts.

## Solution

The `pages/index.js` file in the `bugSolution` folder offers the corrected implementation. The solution focuses on [mention the core correction approach here, e.g., proper dependency initialization, correct API usage, or a workaround].  The updated code avoids the runtime crash and allows the app to function correctly.
